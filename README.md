# Swiggy Sales & Restaurant Performance Analysis  
### SQL Server & Power BI Portfolio Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis of Swiggy food delivery data using **SQL Server (T-SQL)** and **Power BI**.  
The objective is to extract meaningful business insights related to **revenue performance, restaurant ranking, city-wise trends, and customer pricing behavior** from raw transactional data.

The project simulates a **real-world analytics scenario**, where data is cleaned, validated, analyzed using SQL, and visualized through an executive-style Power BI dashboard.
